   <h2>Why am I that much interested in cricket?</h2>
   <p> I would say cricket is a part of our life rather than just a game. Beacuse it teaches you time management, team work and improves our leadership qualities and many more. Since my childhood I have watching and playing cricket with my friends, cousins and colleagues. I would say with the help of cricket only I got my communication skills imoroved also established a strong relationship with my friends.</p>
   <h2>Different formats in cricket</h2>
   <p>These days cricket got many formats but mainly there are just three formats</p>
    <ul>
	  <li>Test Match</li>
	  <li>One Day International</li>
	  <li>T20</li>
	</ul>
   <h2>A brief explanation on these formats</h2>
   <p>Test match is a 5 day game and will be played mostly in daylight i.e from 9Am to 5pm and this time varies with respect to climate. One Day International as the name suggests will be played within a day and is limited over game comprising of 50 overs per side. T20 is the shortest format in the cricket game which have 20 overs per side to play.</p>
   <h2>Most prominent players in cricket history</h2>
   <p> There are hundreds of players till date who marked there legacy in the game. A few of them are </p>
   <ul>
	   <li>Sachin Tendulkar</li>
	   <li>Ricky Ponting</li>
	   <li>Brian Lara</li>
	   <li>Mc Ntini</li>
	   <li>Kevin Pieterson</li>
   </ul>
   <h2> Who inspires me more?</h2>
   <p>It is obviously Virat Kohli. One of the best players in the history who plays with that much commitment and passion. Its the aggression that he portrays in the fields that attracts me more. The support he gives to his juniors is phenominal. He has seen many ups and downs in his life but still he is commited to his passion and stood as one of the top batsmen in the world. </p>
   <p>If I say anything more that would be more like an exxageration. I suggest you to watch the below video to know who he is and what he can do</p>
