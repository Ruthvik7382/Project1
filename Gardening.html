      <h2>What is Gardening?</h2>
        <p> The laying out and care of a plot of ground devoted partially or wholly to the growing of plants such as flowers, herbs, or vegetables. It can be considered both as an art,  concerned with arranging plants harmoniously in their surroundings, and as a science, encompassing the principles and techniques of plant cultivation.</p>

      <h2>Garden Divison</h2>
        <p> The main theme of my garden is that it should be chemical free. And I divided my garden into three parts: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Flowering plants area</li>
          <li>Vegetable plants area</li>
          <li>Medicinal plants area</li>
        </ol>
        <p> As the care that we have to take for each of these categories will be different thats why I seggregated my garden like this so that I can take care of each category at a single point of time. </p>
